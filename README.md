# Survival
---

survival.py is a Python package offering some basic survival analysis tools. All functions in this package are based on the theoretical knowledge from the book **Survival Analysis - Tehcniques for Censored and Truncated Data** by John Klein and Melvin Moeschberger.

The package allows you to perform the following operations:

- Survival times based on Kaplan Meier
	- survival curves with confidence bands
	- plot of cumulative hazard function
	- two sample comparison
	- mean survival time
	- point estimates for linear, log-transformed, arc-sin transformed survival function
	- variance of survival function
	- CH based on Kaplan Meier
	- confidence bands for linear, log-transformed, arc-sin transformation
	- confidence bands using equal probability bands or method by wellner
	
- Estimate of cumulative hazard function based on Nelson-Aalen Estimator
	- point estimates for linear, log-transformed, arc-sin transformed CH
	- estimate of survival function
	- calculation of variance of CH
